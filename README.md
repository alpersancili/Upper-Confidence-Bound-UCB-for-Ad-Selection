# Upper-Confidence-Bound-UCB-for-Ad-Selection
This project implements the UCB algorithm, another approach to solving the MAB problem. UCB is a popular algorithm used to balance exploration and exploitation by selecting actions based on the upper confidence bounds of their expected rewards. This ensures that actions with high uncertainty, potentially high rewards are explored more frequently.
